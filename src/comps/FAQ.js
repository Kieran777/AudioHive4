                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">Do we have our own Backline, and if so, what Backline do we have?</h3>
                <p>No, we do not have our own Backline. Instead, if the venue does not have their own
Backline, and the event organizer is not sourcing the Backline separately, we have our
own list of reliable third-party sources that we rent from.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">What are some of our price estimates?</h3>
                <p>We do not have a set rate, because every show has a different scale, budget, and
outcome. Instead, we evaluate every show separately based on the equipment and labor
required.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">Do we have a resident live sound engineer, or will the event organizer have to source
their own?</h3>
                <p>Yes, in fact, we have 3 very experienced live sound engineers with over 50 years of
combined experience in the industry.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">Are we only based in Johannesburg?</h3>
                <p>We are based in Johannesburg, but we frequently travel across the country for various
shows and events. Additionally, we do have our own means of gear transportation, so we
are always prepared for long distance shows.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">How many camera operators do we employ?</h3>
                <p>We employ four experienced camera operators, each of whom have years of
experience in the field.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">Are we contractually limited in terms of equipment use?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. We have strictly maintained a policy of avoiding limitations. We have
our own preferred brands, and our own sponsorship, but we are happy and able to use
equipment from various different brands and companies, as long at the equipment is high
quality and reliable.</p>
