                <h4 className="highlightHeadings">This equipment list can be used to record various common live show instrument setups
which include drums, guitars, keys, woodwind, brass and string sections, piano and
vocals, and is versatile enough to record many other less common instrument setups
which might include marimbas and other orchestral percussion, traditional instruments,
and other digital instrumentation such as synthesizers and virtual instruments.</h4>

                <h3 className="highlightHeadings">Software</h3>
                <p>In terms of Software, we work primarily in Pro Tools or Ableton Live, depending
on what preference there might be by the performers, event organisers or our
employers. If no preference exists, the team chooses the DAW that works best
with the available hardware, and the purpose of the show. Should the event
require the use of another DAW, our resident engineers have experience in
various other DAWs, such as Logic, Cubase, FL Studio, and others. If our
engineers have not worked on the required software before, the event organiser
will be required to source an engineer to man the software.</p>
